    "### Suggested report format\n",
    "A suggested lab report format includes the following sections: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Title \n",
    "- Abstract \n",
    "- Table of Contents\n",
    "- List of symbols\n",
    "- Introduction\n",
    "- Approach/ Methods\n",
    "- Results \n",
    "- Discussion\n",
    "- Conclusions\n",
    "- References\n",
    "- Appendices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text \n",
    "\n",
    "The text should give essential information in a concise fashion and avoid unnecessary duplication in text, tables, and figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equations\n",
    "Equations should be numbered and be referred in the text, e.g., Eq. 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Figures and tables\n",
    "Both tables and figures should have captions and be numbered. All figures and tables should be refered in the text as “in Figure x …, see Table y, …\" , etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Captions\n",
    "- Figure captions are placed **below** the figure.\n",
    "- Table captions are place **above** the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Presenting data \n",
    "\n",
    "Figures must have labeled axes with proper physical dimensions and units.  Label fonts should be of font size similar to the text font.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a lot of scatter in the data, the individual points should not be connected by straight lines, see Figure 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img_00/incorrectplot.png\" width = 600 height = 600>\n",
    "<center>Figure 1 : Data points connected with line</center>\n",

    "Rather the data points should be left as is or a trend line should be added, see Figure 2. \n",

    "<center>Figure 2 : Data with trendline added </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "In tables, units must always be included as part of the captions for each column or row. Special care must be taken when reporting numbers with exponents in tables as a common mistake is easily done.  The tabulated velocity data below is an example:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Symbols, Units and Terminology\n",

    "\n",
    "Mathematical symbols should be in roman font, symbols for quantities or variables should be _italicized_ (vectors in __boldface__) and units should given in roman font. \n",

    "When expressing a quantity value, a space should be left between the numerical value and the unit symbol.\n",

    "\n",
    "Results have little use unless they are reported with the proper number of significant digits and accompanied by meaningful uncertainty.  A brief description of the uncertainties should be given.\n",

    "Here is an example of how results should be reported: \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that water velocity is measured as $U$ = 12.1 m/s (3 significant digits), sphere diameter is $D$ = 0.02540 m (4 significant digits), and the water viscosity is $\\nu$ = 0.9980 × $10^{-6}$ $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$ (4 significant digits).\n",

    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "Re = \\frac{U \\times D}{\\nu} = \\frac{\\big(12.1 \\ \\mathrm{m/s} \\big) \\times \\big(0.02540 \\ \\mathrm{m}\\big)}{\\big(0.9980 × 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}\\big)} = 3.07955912 \\times 10^5 \\approx 3.08 \\times 10^5 \n",

    "## Significant Digits\n",
    "\n",
    "Significant digits is the **number of useful digits in a measurement/calculation**. They  are an important aspect of technical reports, as they imply **precision** in a reported result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- For decimal numbers, all the digits after the leading zeros are significant.\n",
    "- For numbers in scientific notation, all the digits are significant. \n",
    "- For integer numbers without trailing zeros, all the digits are considered significant.\n",
    "- For integer numbers with trailing zeros, all the digits except for the trailing zeros are considered significant and the trailing zeros may or may not be significant depending on the application. To avoid ambiguity, it is better to write such numbers in scientific notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of significant digits is determined by the number of digits between and including the most and least significant digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The leftmost significant digit is called the **most significant digit**; the rightmost significant digit is called the **least significant digit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples** \n",
    "\n",
    "1)  $ 45543 \\rightarrow $ 5 significant digits, 4 is the most significant digit and 3 is the least significant digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2)  $ 0.000540 \\rightarrow $ 3 significant digits, 5 is the most significant digit and 0 is the least significant digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3)  $654320 \\rightarrow $ Here the number of the significant digits and the least significant digit are ambiguous. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ambiguity can be avoided by expressing the number in scientific notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ 654320 \\rightarrow  6.54320 \\times 10^5 \\rightarrow $ 6 significant digits, 6 is the most significant digit and 0 is the least significant digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Underline notation\n",
    "\n",
    "In case that the number of significant digits is given, we can underline the least significant digit by counting digits from the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Round-off rules\n",
    "How to truncate a number to desired length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine the digit following the **least significant digit**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if it is $ < 5 \\rightarrow $ truncate excess digits,  $65\\underline{4},321 \\rightarrow 654,000 $\n",
    "- if it is $ > 5 \\rightarrow $ round up least significant digit,  $65\\underline{4},621 \\rightarrow 655,000 $\n",
    "- if it is =5:\n",
    "  - if least sig dig is odd $\\rightarrow$ Round up,  $65\\underline{3},500 \\rightarrow 654,000$\n",
    "  - if least sig dig is even $\\rightarrow$ Truncate, $65\\underline{4},500 \\rightarrow 654,000$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addition and subtraction \n",
    "\n",
    "For addition and subtraction, look at the decimal portion (i.e., to the right of the decimal point) of the numbers **only**. Here is what to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Count the number of significant figures in the decimal portion of each number in the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Add or subtract in the normal fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Round the answer to the LEAST number of places in the decimal portion of any number in the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "$ 14.58 + 0.0137 = 14.5937 \\rightarrow 14.59 $\n",
    "\n",
    "$90.00 + 18.0 + 142.121 = 250.121 \\rightarrow 250.1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiplication and division \n",
    "\n",
    "The result should have the same number of significant digits as the component with the least number of significant digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "$ 4.34 \\times 5.4344 = 23.585296 \\rightarrow 23.6 $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fundamental and physical constants\n",
    "\n",
    "For calculations with fundamental constants or physical constants, we do not use the above rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "You obtain a measurement of $x$ = 0.325 m and want to multiply it by 2 according to a formula. The result should be 0.650 m and not 0.6 m. You can think of 2 as 2.000.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the conversion factors are known _exactly_, the number of significant digits does not change when converting between units.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "$ T = 100.0185  $ °C\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert in K,\n",
    "\n",
    " K $ = 273.15 + $ °C $ = 273.15 + 100.0185 = 373.1685 $ K\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculation error progagation\n",
    "We must be careful about rounding off numbers during sequential analysis of data. All digits should be carried and the final result should be round off according to the rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, we can introduce and propagate systematic error in our calculations and obtain skewed results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expressing uncertainty\n",
    "The convention in uncertainty analysis requires the reported value to have the same precision with the associated uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "$ 2.5 \\pm 0.1 \\ \\mathrm{m/s} $"

    "\n",
    "7. All equations must be numbered and be referenced in the text. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Each reports should contain a minimum of a schematic of the circuit diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. All calculations should include appropriate units (SI), and correct signiﬁcant digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. The ﬁrst section of the report should be an abstract which summarizes the results of the lab in one paragraph. \n",
